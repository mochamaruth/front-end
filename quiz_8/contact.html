        <p>Soft shades, like blues, grays, greens, and purples all offer a calming atmosphere. For instance, mix cornflower blue with a light gray to give your space an airy, beach-like feel. Neutral tones like cream also work well in a bedroom.

To implement the colors of your choosing, buy a bedspread, rugs and art that fits the decor. Your furniture can match or provide contrast either option enhances the space.
Bathroom

Another (very) private space, your bathroom can feel luxurious or fresh. If you want a more serene space, go with pastels and a cool color palette. For instance, pale green and natural wood create a spa-like feel. If you prefer a royal-looking room, use golds and natural stone colors.

Your bath linens and accessories (like a toilet brush and toothbrush holder) can help you give the room the look you are after.Hopefully, these room color ideas and suggestions help you plan your apartment decor.

However, it is your place and you should do what makes you happy. If you want your bedroom to feel energetic, use a warm palette, for instance. Your apartment must cater to your personal tastes, and if color theory and psychology fits, great!</p>
